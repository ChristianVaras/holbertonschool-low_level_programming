# 0x04.C - More functions, more nested loops

In this project, I continued to learn about using nested loops and writing functions in C.
## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. isupper**
  * [0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c): C function that checks for uppercase characters. Returns
  `1` if the character is uppercase, `0` otherwise.
